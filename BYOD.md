Bring your own device (BYOD) refers to being allowed to use one's personally owned device rather than being required to use an officially provided device. There are two major contexts in which this term is used. One is in the mobile phone industry, where it refers to carriers allowing customers to activate their existing phone (or other cellular device) on the network, rather than being forced to buy a new device from the carrier. The other is in the workplace, where it refers to a policy of permitting employees to bring personally owned devices (laptops, tablets, smartphones, etc.) to work, and to use those devices to access privileged company information and applications. [1]
The proliferation of devices such as tablets and smartphones, now used by many people in their daily lives, has led to a number of companies, such as IBM, to allow employees to bring their own devices to work, due to perceived productivity gains and cost savings. The idea was initially rejected because of security concerns but more and more companies are now looking to incorporate BYOD policies. According to a 2018 study, only 17 percent of enterprises provide mobile phones to all employees, while 31 percent provide to none and instead rely entirely on BYOD. The remaining 52 percent have some kind of hybrid approach where some employees receive corporate mobile phones and others are expected to bring their own. According to research by Logicalis, high-growth markets (including Brazil, Russia, India, UAE, and Malaysia) demonstrate a much higher propensity to use their own device at work. Almost 75% of users in these countries did so, compared to 44% in the more mature developed markets.[1]
There are two components to addressing the issues related to BYOD: technical and non-technical. The non-technical component includes policy and awareness. A comprehensive and realistic BYOD policy is needed, and users need to be educated. There are two main technical tools for addressing BYOD.  Mobile Device Management, or MDM, is the generic term for software suites that are used for  managing your mobile device deployment. Data loss prevention, or DLP, is a strategy to avoid exporting sensitive data outside of the boundaries defined by the organization[2]. Many companies have adopted both strategies to secure their network.

Besides the technical challenges, security and privacy are the primary BYOD risks. Technical challenges include connecting to wifi, accessing network resources like shared files or printers, and addressing device compatibility issues. Security and privacy are risks faced by both organizations and employees in different ways. Organizations tend to be more concerned about the security of corporate data (and how user behavior threatens it). Employees are more concerned about the privacy and confidentiality of their personal data (and what rights their employers have to access it). [3]

The BYOD market is set to reach nearly $367 billion by 2022, up from a mere $30 billion in 2014. Clearly it will continue to be adopted by employers compelled by the potential benefits, as well as employees keen to enjoy greater flexibility. In short, BYOD is here to stay. Nevertheless, it seems more likely that companies will commission Bring Your Own Device programs to augment, rather than overhaul, their traditional way of working. The best of both worlds, in other words, will be the order of the day.[4]

 ‘BYOD’ stands for Bring your own device. BYOD is a growing business IT trend that describes when an enterprise allows individuals (either employees or consumers) to use their personal devices (or previously owned devices in the case of consumers) to work or to a different networking mobile company – instead of utilizing the official company provided device. In the last decade BYOD has become more popular in the workplace and it is now even considered a characteristic of a ‘flexible’ company’s culture for some employees.

As BYOD becomes more popular, most organizations have responded by adopting these policies along with security measurements in order to attempt to minimize the encountered risks while still taking advantage of the efficiencies BYOD can generate. Other companies have not embraced the trend with opened arms but as time passes even some of these companies are coming around and considering implementing ‘bring your own technology’ (BYOT). According to the cnxounplugged article and the white paper published by Ovum in 2012, companies during that period were engaging in BYOD devices at different rates and preferences based on the level of market development (emerging economies vs developed/mature markets), with a higher usage and preferability in the emerging economies: approximately 75% in emerging markets vs 44% in mature markets. According to Frost and Sullivan’s research on 2018, adoption of BYOD in the USA has increased approximately 15% from 2011 to 2018, with most organizations – as of 2018- in the USA (~78.5%) having BYOD activities.

When companies allow employees to use their own device, they usually update the company’s network design, including network level controls, to adapt to BYOD and thus minimize the security risks that arise when companies’ data is being accessed through personal devices and, in some cases,  data maintained in these devices as well. As noted by Frost and Sullivan’s research, some of the network controls adopted by companies include- but is not limited to: Network Access controls (i.e. VPN), Wireless Access point (WAP), and the monitoring of traffic in the network. There are multiple tools and software that provide the level of control and monitoring companies are looking for, specially at the network-layer, that are compatible and preferred when BYOD policies are implemented

The biggest risk identified with BYOD is the security of data. As noted by Tony Bradley within his 2011 pcworld article, the lack of control over the devices when using BYOD creates certain issues and concerns around security requirements. In addition to the security of this data, when using BYOD there is a fine line between what should be under the employee’s control and ownership and what is under the employer’s ownership. When data compliance mandates such as HIPPA, applicable to the Health services industry for example, are added to the mix the considerations become more complex. Due to the complexities, there is not a silver bullet that can mitigate all areas of risks. For example, well designed and implemented network layer controls could substantially mitigate the risk of a former employee currently having access to their former confidential company’s data through their personal device; however network layer controls are not very effective when one of the current employees does not establish a strong password and the personal device used to access company’s data is left unprotected.  Thus, in addition to the technical side updates that companies must implement to adapt to BYOD, we must consider the user-side of all this and the risks that come up due to ‘unacceptable’ (intentional or unintentional) usage of BYOD. To help mitigate these risks, companies must create and implement a clearly defined “acceptable use” BYOD policy. Company wide training related to the Acceptable use policy is equally important as well.

I do not see a clear line between work and personal lives in general when looking forward 5-10 years. Due to the flexibility that the mobile technologies provide, specifically the efficiencies obtained with BYOD, more companies and individuals will continue to opt for BYOD. That being said, companies will continue to improve their understanding of risks pose by BYOD and the additional efficiencies to be gained from it. Additionally, regulations and control frameworks will continue to be updated and companies will be required to work on addressing control gaps, updating policies and hardening their network environment in order to comply with them. As with most trends in business, there are advantages and disadvantages to BYOD policies. Taking more of a holistic approach and involving more than the IT department leaders from companies (i.e. HR, legal) when making decisions around BYOD policies is key as well. Knowing both pros and cons and looking at these through different lenses would allow enterprises, specifically IT departments, to make informed decisions when implementing clearly defined ‘acceptable used’ BYOD policies and when designing and implementing controls in order to minimize the risks that BYOD technologies brings with it.

 •What is BYOD?

BYOD, or bring your own device, is a practice of employees who bring their own computing devices – such as smartphones, laptops and tablets – to the workplace for use and connectivity on the secure corporate network.

The term was initially used by a VoIP service provider BroadVoice in 2004 (initially for AstriCon, but then continued as a core part of the business model) with a service allowing businesses to bring their own device for a more open service provider model. The phrase and the "BYOD" acronym is a take-off on "BYOB", a party invitation term first recorded in the 1970s, standing for "bring your own beer/booze/bottle.


•How have organizations responded to BYOD?

Just like any new change initially organizations were skeptical & employees were asked to refrain from using their personal devices at work, however as the personal devices became smarter with powerful some companies like Intel in 2009 were quick to embrace it as a means to cut costs and improve productivity. There are quite a few benefits however not without risks to BYOD. Most Organizations are also aware of that and are enabling their IT / Legal / HR teams to formulate a way to use the BYOD for its benefits & mitigating the risks.
According to a 2018 study, only 17 percent of enterprises provide mobile phones to all employees, while 31 percent provide to none and instead rely entirely on BYOD. The remaining 52 percent have some kind of hybrid approach where some employees receive corporate mobile phones and others are expected to bring their own.
The Middle East has one of the highest adoption rates (about 80%) of the practice worldwide in 2012.
According to research by Logicalis, high-growth markets (including Brazil, Russia, India, UAE, and Malaysia) demonstrate a much higher propensity to use their own device at work. Almost 75% of users in these countries did so, compared to 44% in the more mature developed markets.
In the UK, the CIPD Employee Outlook Survey 2013 revealed substantial variations by industry in the prevalence of BYOD.



•How have organizations adapted to BYOD with networking?

With the introduction of the BYOD, Organizations need to adapt to the BYOD with the Networking. Business owners and network managers must agree on the type of support, additional software to manage mobile devices such as mobile device management (MDM) software, amendments to the network security policy, creating a separate BYOD policy, and Voice over IP (VoIP) usage, Data loss prevention, or DLP, a strategy to avoid exporting sensitive data outside of the boundaries defined by the organization

Following are the few pointers Businesses need to look into, considering the Impact of BYOD on the networking.

    Security

    Above all, security should be the main concern when adopting BYOD into a network. Employees will bring multiple devices using multiple operating systems connected to multiple wireless and service networks. Managing everything may require MDM software to reduce administrative levels of effort to take control and minimize security vulnerabilities.

    A BYOD security policy should provide company governance to help network administrators manage mobile devices and ensure that no personally owned devices used for work compromise security. Most MDM software includes remote wipe technology that allows the user or support personnel to wipe a device’s work-related files upon an employee’s termination or resignation or in the event of device loss; remote provisioning to push updates, patches, and documents to employees; and access control security.

    VoIP 

    A company that already has a VoIP system that offers VoIP apps can enforce the app’s use for business calls. Employees can keep their personal and work-related calls separate and won’t have to rely on their personal voice plan and minutes. Company-purchased VoIP apps are useful for voice and video calls as well as file sharing. These apps should include user access authentication and authorization, such as a login and password, to increase security.

    A BYOD policy should also provide guidance to avoid VoIP phishing or voice phishing (vishing) attempts. Vishing is a form of social engineering over the phone to obtain sensitive information for malicious intent, such as financial gain through the exploitation of public trust. General awareness is up to the employee to protect against vishing attempts by requiring verification of the caller or simply hanging up and calling the agency or institution directly that the caller claimed to represent.

    Management 

    Network performance should not be affected by BYOD, and the following lines provide guidance for managing a solid performance framework. BYOD policy should be designed around the apps installed on personal devices over the company’s network. Users should be restricted through MDM software to download only those apps available through the company’s app store or company-approved apps from Apple iOS or Google Play.

    Creating network tiers can help administrators set voice and data priority in BYOD environments. Personal voice and data should not bog down a company network, because converged voice and data networks are already latency dependent. Network tiers can avoid quality issues from employees streaming videos for personal use. Video, gaming, and other traffic on an employee device should get low or zero priority. Network tiers can help businesses collect key performance indicators to properly monitor and assess their network’s performance.

    Data Loss Prevention

    Data loss prevention, or DLP, is a strategy to avoid exporting sensitive data outside of the boundaries defined by the organization. There are several types of DLP tools: some look for sensitive data, like social security numbers, on the wire. Some look for sensitive company files (like the marketing strategy for your company's latest soon-to-be hit product). But all serve the purpose of keeping sensitive data from going where it doesn't belong.









•What areas of risk have been identified for BYOD?


Although the ability of staff to work at anytime from anywhere and on any device provides real business benefits, it also brings significant risks. Following are key points


    Local exposure   
    Loss of control and visibility of the enterprise data which is being transmitted, stored, and processed on a personal device. One of the inherent downsides to BYOD.

     

    Data leakage
    Potential data leakage or disclosure of enterprise data from an unsecured device

    Data loss 
    Physical loss or theft of a device (and thereby loss or compromise of sensitive data)

    Public exposure
    Susceptibility to man-in-the-middle attacks and eavesdropping at public wifi hotspots often used by remote workers. Connecting to personal area networks, e.g. using Bluetooth, poses similar security risks.

    Insecure usage
    Unacceptable use of a BYOD by a third party, e.g. friends or family at home

    Malicious apps
    Devices with compromised integrity. An example is applications with different levels of trust installed on the same device. For instance, allowing push notifications or enabling location-based services. A malicious application may be able to sniff, modify, or steal inter-application messages thereby compromising trusted applications on the device.  In addition, even apps from official app stores may be compromised. In 2015, Wired reported that Apple removed over 300 pieces of software from the app store. This after malware that targeted developers’ tool sets managed to create infected iOS apps.

    Rogue apps
    By gaining root access to mobile devices, there’s a risk that users (aka “rogue employees”) can bypass security restrictions. In some cases, they may install rogue apps.

    Cross contamination
    Just one of the (many) risks of having personal and corporate information housed on the same device. Corporate data may be accidentally deleted.

    OS-specific security customization
    “Jailbreaking”, “root”, and “unlock” are three popular procedures that users may execute on personal devices to remove vendors’ configuration restrictions. This makes them more vulnerable to insecure applications. They may be able to access device sensors (e.g. microphone, camera) or sensitive data stored on the device without restrictions.  

    Insider attacks
    Vulnerability to insider attacks which are difficult to prevent since they occur in the local area network (LAN) of an organization using a valid user profile

    Phone number Problem
    A key issue of BYOD which is often overlooked is BYOD's phone number problem, which raises the question of the ownership of the phone number. The issue becomes apparent when employees in sales or other customer-facing roles leave the company and take their phone number with them. Customers calling the number will then potentially be calling competitors, which can lead to loss of business for BYOD enterprises

     

    Additional Cost

    Software developers and device manufacturers constantly release security patches to counteract threats from malware. IT departments that support organizations with a BYOD policy must have systems and processes to apply patches protecting systems against known vulnerabilities of the devices that users may use. Ideally, such departments should have agile systems that can quickly adopt the support necessary for new devices. Supporting a broad range of devices obviously carries a large administrative overhead. Organizations without a BYOD policy have the benefit of selecting a small number of devices to support, while organizations with a BYOD policy could also limit the number of supported devices, though this could defeat the objective of allowing users the freedom to choose their preferred device freely. Also confusion regarding the reimbursement for the use of a personal device. A recent court ruling in California indicates the need of reimbursement if an employee is required to use their personal device for work. In other cases, companies can have trouble navigating the tax implications of reimbursement and the best practices surrounding reimbursement for personal device use. A 2018 study found that 89 percent of organizations with a BYOD policy provide a full or partial stipend to compensate employees for their mobile phone expenses. On average, these organizations paid employees $36 per month as a BYOD stipend.


 


 


•What does the future hold for BYOD?


 


Although BYOD has become quite popular but historically speaking, technology trends tend to evolve and current trend will continue, as long as something better doesn’t come along.


BYOD Research – Key Findings:


    Respondents in the emerging, “high-growth” markets (including Brazil, Russia, India, UAE, and Malaysia) demonstrate a much higher propensity to use their own device at work. Almost 75% of users in these countries did so, compared to 44% in the more mature developed markets.
    79% of employees in high growth markets believe that constant connectivity with work applications enables them to their job better, versus 53.5% in mature markets.
    78.6% of employees in high growth markets like the flexibility of being able to use mobile enterprise application access outside work hours, versus 55.1% in mature markets.
    Attitudes to single device ownership again show divergence between emerging and mature markets, with 59.1% of respondents wanting a single device in high growth markets and 37.7% expressing preference for a single device in mature markets.
    There is a distinct lack of BYOD management – everywhere. On average only 20.1% of employees who use personal devices have also signed a policy governing that behaviour. USA and India are nearer to 50%.
    With the exception of Russia, there is a high level of acceptance and encouragement of BYOD by IT departments in high growth markets. Interestingly in mature markets this is mirrored in the Anglosphere countries of the USA, UK and Australia. In the rest of Europe and Japan there is a significant (over 40%) tendency to ignoring that it is taking place, or simply not know that it is taking place.


It’s evident from the above research that the BYOD is quite popular in the emerging markets rather than mature markets. As BYOD matures, enterprise organizations have adopted formalized policies, resources, and management methods to adapt. Here's some of the key BYOD trends that may affect the BYOD landscape in 2020 and beyond.


    Further Growth

    It's predicted that the global BYOD market will exceed $350bn by 2022, up from just $94bn in 2014. This is due to widespread adoption of portable devices that employees bring to work with them. And, the increasing number of businesses implementing enterprise mobility solutions that enable and encourage employees to work at anytime, anywhere, from a wide range of devices. Employees find it more convenient than ever to conduct work activities on a device that's familiar to them. Be it by accessing work-related communication channels on their personal smartphone, or drafting business emails from their own laptop.
    Studies show that this approach to working lets staff utilize the benefits of greater flexibility, collaboration, and work-life balance to improve productivity by up to 34%. Businesses are keen to encourage these productivity benefits, so it's not surprising that the latest market insights report that positive growth may continue up until 2026.

     

    Enterprise BYOD Security Becomes Zero-Trust

    The traditional enterprise security perimeter — once limited to private networks — has diminished to only a handful of organizations. Today's innovative businesses enable B YOD policies to remain cutting-edge, however it's easy to understand why employee personal devices combined with sensitive work-related networks create security risks.
    In 2020, a major security issue for enterprise-use personal devices is distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Most notably, reports show that instances of DDoS attacks have increased overall since 2018. This security risk highlights a significant red flag, so businesses are changing their approach.
    However, determining how your IT department can control these new-found risks (and how to apply an internal policy to external devices) can become an overly- complex issue — especially as your employee device network grows unrestricted.
    To tackle this, BYOD policy compliance tools are now widely adopted. They encourage employees to use devices responsibly and support organizations to formalize management methods.

    Moreover, it's predicted that zero-trust innovations, such as artificial intelligence (Al), will enhance BYOD security management in the future. It's hoped that Al will provide automatic insights into end-user behaviour, helping identify potential security threats before they occur. With these advances on the horizon, the global BYOD security market segment is expected to grow in 2020.

     

    Employee Privacy is a Greater Concern

    With greater security comes closer scrutiny of company networks, and scrutiny of this data requires businesses to take a closer look at how employees use personal devices for work.
    However, a BYOD policy can open a figurative rabbit-hole that blurs the line between personal and work-related data. In fact, one of the main drivers of employees resisting a BYOD policy is fear of their workplace 'snooping' on their personal device.
    In 2020, employers will overcome this by improving transparency about employee data visibility and using best-practice solutions for managing B YOD data. A BY OD management solution that ensures enterprise data stays secure while preserving end-user privacy will promote trust amongst employees, better secure your organization, and manage employee privacy concerns.

     

    BYOD Policies Include Employee 'Enhancements'

    Gartner predicts that by 2023 30% of IT organizations will extend their B YOD policy to cater for 'enhancements' in the workforce. An 'enhancement' is a physical augmentation, such as a smartwatch, that a worker wears in their personal life. Growing consumer demand means employees want to capitalize on the benefits they experience from 'enhancements' in their day-to-day routines, including at
    work. For example, future office-based organizations could one day share work- related networks to their employee's wearable, letting individual staff members see meeting invites, work emails, or time-sensitive deadlines from a smartwatch.

    CYOD Initiatives Will Emerge

    Is it a typo? No, It's Choose Your Own Device (CYOD). Put simply, a CYOD policy enables your IT department to supply a set choice of devices for employees. This means workers use a company-owned device instead of their own, eliminating some of the security risks found in traditional BYOD.
    However, CYOD can be less cost-effective. Purchasing, managing, and maintaining a network of company-owned portable devices can be costly, especially when your internal teams manage them. More so, providing a device to each member of your team can expensive as your business grows in numbers.
    Businesses can take a strategic approach to C YOD by only allocating devices to certain people. However, BYOD will still remain more inclusive, flexible, and cost- effective in the long term.

     

    BYOD will Help Businesses Be 5G-Ready

    No 2020 mobile management trend analysis would be complete without mentioning 5G. In the future, powerful 5G networks will keep employees more connected than ever, with higher data rates and lower latency — so end-users experience fewer delays.
    Consumer demand for 5G has gained momentum, and employees might well already be fully-equipped with 5G-ready devices. For enterprise businesses, this lessens the financial impact of providing the latest and greatest technology for each device holder. Employees will be autonomously engaging with 5G technology in their personal lives, making it easier to fulfil organizational 5G objectives.

    How to Prepare for the Future of BYOD

    To reap the benefits of BYOD, Organizations need a large-scale approach of effectively managing employee personal devices without hindering privacy, security, or cost- management concerns.
    Most importantly, BYOD policies needs to provide incentives to encourage BYOD uptake, a business, so as to maintain security.
