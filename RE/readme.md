I finally decided to start learning RE. 

I am planning to practice with crackme.

* For the easier one I will be trying the [ioli](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2book/tree/master/crackmes/ioli)
* For some advance ones, [crackmes.one](https://crackmes.one/lasts)

I thing I'd just use radare2 and if I need decompiling then will either use ghidra or with ghidra wrapper for radare2
